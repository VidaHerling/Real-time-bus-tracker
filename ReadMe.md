## Description
This is an exercise from the MIT XPro - Professional Certificate for Coding. My tasks in this exercise were to
* retrieve real time locations of a bus using JavaScript (async and await)
* create a map and bus location markers - tracking the buses' locations every 10 seconds and showing the movement on the map. 

## How to Run
You may clone this repo to your local machine and make any modification as you like. Have fun!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
* add bus stop markers to the map
* add more information of each bus on the popup box
